Introduction: This project will first construct a game called Hexapawn which is close to chess but using only pawns. Then the game will have a simple AI oponent
              that gets harder the more you play it against. This project will focus on learnin how computers learn, in this case the AI will learn through punishment
              as for every loss the computer will be punished and the losing move will be removed from his movepool. Playing for long enough the AI will play perfectly
              and never lose.
              
System Overview: The game will mostly be built as a class of it's own with class states holding the data. The AI oponent will be another component and the knowledge of which moves
                  are losing will be stored in a text file which can be accessed by the AI. There will also be an option to play with friends or against the machine.
                  
Possible Challenges: The hardest parts will be to construct a way for the computer to interact with the data and build the game itself but overall this will be a fairly
                      simple project and manageable to do it on my own.
               
References: This idea was inspired by a video from Vsauce2 by the name of "The Game That Learns", in the video they use matchboxes as a "computer" so I thought translating that
            to actual code would be fun.
